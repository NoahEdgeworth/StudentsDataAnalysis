# StudentsDataAnalysis
An analysis of different student stress factors from a dataset found on Kaggle.com using Jupyter Notebook and Python

This analysis answers multiple questions about descriptive, psychological, physiological, environmental, academic, and social factors.

There are also a few comparative analysis questions answered at the end that have some pretty interesting findings!

This is my first data analysis project being uploaded to GitHub, so please feel free to leave any feedback you may have.
